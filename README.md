# RDR2 Texture Toolkit

A tool forked off of Neodymium's GTA5 Texture Toolkit, that allows you to create RDR2 texture files without requiring to buy GTA5. 

## How it works:

This is basically Neodymium's GTA5 Texture toolkit but only with the components to create a texture file (.ytd). This means that you can't export the files from ymt files but you can do that with OpenIV. You can't also load ymt files. This program also uses the RedM ymt file converter from the RedM client to convert the files to the ymt format that RDR2 recognizes.

## How to Use: 

NOTE: Better instructions will be coming later.

After opening the program, click File>New.
Now you can import files by clicking Edit>Import. NOTE: The program only accepts DDS files explicitly. This means if the file ends in .dds but wont open in the program, the file is not in DDS format even if it ends in .dds. If you need to delete a unwanted image, select the image you want to delete then click Edit>Delete.
When you are ready to create a new ymt file, click File>Save. Select the folder to put the ymt file in.
Two ymt files will be created. The ymt file that has "_nya" in it, is the file that can be used in RDR2. You can delete the other file.
The ymt file that has "_nya" in it, can now be renamed to whatever you want and can now be used in Lenny's Mod Loader.
